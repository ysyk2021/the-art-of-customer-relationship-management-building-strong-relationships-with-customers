By focusing on building strong relationships with customers, organizations can increase their chances of long-term success.

Historical Perspectives on CRM Theory and Practice

The concept of CRM has been around for decades, but the evolution of technology has greatly impacted its theory and practice. In the 1980s, CRM was primarily focused on database marketing, which involved collecting and analyzing customer data to target specific audiences. In the 1990s, the focus shifted to sales force automation, which involved using technology to streamline sales processes.

Today, CRM is much more comprehensive, incorporating various technologies and strategies to manage customer relationships across multiple channels and touchpoints. This includes social media, mobile devices, email, and other forms of digital communication.
